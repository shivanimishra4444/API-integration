# cobiro-integration
I have spent around 6 hrs on this assignement and I could implement below features
## Implemented features:
1) Login
2) View List of sites
3) View detail of selected sites
4) Create new sites with only 5 fields(name, url, currency, platform and language)
5) Edit Selected sites
6) Navigation with navbar
7) Protected routes with authentication
8) Authentication using cookies.

## If I had more time then I could have worked on below features
1) Signup 
2) More detailed test cases
3) create sites with all fields
4) comments and documentation

## Tech stack
1) React 
2) Typescript
3) Webpack
4) react-route
5) Bootstrap
6) Jest and enzyme for test case

## Application Architecture
  I have used react with typescript in order to enhance code quality and understandability. For this application, I have used my 
  existing react-typescript-seed available at my github profile. I have split the application into several components which 
  enhance the code reusability and the maintainability as the application grows further. I have kept API 
  integration at one place which provides seperation of concerns. For protecting the authenticated routes, I have imlemented AuthenticatedRoute
  component inspite of using any third party library.
  
 ## intruction to run the application
 * ```npm i```
 * ```npm start```
 * ```jest``` - to run test case
